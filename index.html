      <h2> Drawing and making art is one of my favorite hobby!</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Art, also called (to distinguish it from other art forms) visual art, a visual object or experience consciously created through an expression of skill or imagination. The term art encompasses diverse media such as painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, decorative arts, photography, and installation. I love making art becuase it is calming and after you finish the finishing piece is wonderful. I feel and happiness when making art. Art is the best!

 <h1>My Family, My Inspiration</h1>
       <h2> Inspiration to me is when a person gives me enough motives to do or feel something creative or beneficial to others or myself. Each person in my life is very important as to why I am the person I am today. They all have different characteristics of inspiration that they have given me. My first thoughts of my family are always why they mean so much to me. I couldnâ€™t imagine my life without anyone of my family members. My mom loves art which made my want to do art to. She is also a computer enginner which made he want to code. My mom is a a big Inspiration to me!</h2>
